# IPL-Analysis
Explored 750+ IPL matches &amp; 1.5L deliveries using Python &amp; pandas to uncover hidden insights in team strategy, player performance &amp; match trends. From toss impact to death-over drama—this EDA blends cricket passion with data science precision. 
This project presents a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL), aiming to uncover meaningful insights from one of the world's most dynamic and competitive T20 cricket tournaments. Using two primary datasets—matches.csv and deliveries.csv—the analysis spans over 750 matches and 150,000+ ball-by-ball records, offering granular insights into team strategies, player performance, match outcomes, and evolving trends.

The project focuses on answering key analytical questions such as:

Does winning the toss influence the final result?

Are teams more successful while chasing or defending totals?

Which players and franchises consistently outperform?

How do different phases of an innings (powerplay, middle overs, death overs) affect scoring and wicket-taking patterns?

Key tools and technologies used include Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, with the analysis conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The data was cleaned and merged to ensure consistency across team and player names, and various visualizations were used to highlight trends and patterns.

The study reveals that while toss wins offer a slight strategic edge—especially when choosing to chase—it is execution, consistency, and leadership that determine long-term success. Franchises like Mumbai Indians (MI) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) exemplify this with their dominance across seasons. Player-wise, legends like AB de Villiers, MS Dhoni, Chris Gayle, and Jadeja emerged as high-impact contributors.

This project not only showcases practical data science skills but also demonstrates how raw sports data can be transformed into strategic storytelling. It offers valuable insights for analysts, fans, and cricket strategists, while also serving as a portfolio piece in applied data analytics.
